## How it works

A mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that satisfy a certain mathematical property. The set is defined by iterating a function on a complex number, and checking if the result of the iteration is bounded. If the result is bounded, the complex number is part of the mandelbrot set. If the result is unbounded, the complex number is not part of the mandelbrot set.

This project calculates the function `z = z^2 + c` iteratively, where `z` and `c` are complex numbers. The function is iterated on
every clock cycle, and the result is checked to see if it is bounded (`|z| <= 2`). When the result is unbounded, the `unbounded` signal is set high.

All the calculations are done in 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point format. The floating point addition code is taken from [Caravel FPU](https://github.dev/Lampro-Mellon/Caravel_FPU/blob/main/verilog/rtl/add_sub.sv), and the floating point multiplication code was generated by GPT-4o.

## How to test

Shift the values of the complex number `c` through `Cr[3:0]` (for the real part) and `Ci[3:0]` (for the imaginary part), LSB first. Strobe the `start` signal to begin the calculation. The `unbounded` signal will be set high when the result is unbounded (as soon as `|z| > 2`).
